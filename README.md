# Family Tree

Information from over 600,000 individuals has been pulled from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) using [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) in python. 

The `path()` method uses breadth-first search to find the shortest path between 2 people, and prints out all individual in the path.

Disclaimer: As the data is from Wikidata, which is a collaboratively edited knowledge base, not all connections can be verified. References are included on the individuals wikidata page where available.
